# Front End Mentor Challenges
Thsi repository contains all the challenges that I have completed from the [FrontEndMentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions). The challenges varied from creating simple components, pages, to small-scale applications. 

Each challenge used various tools to complete, each section in this README contains the challenge name, description, tools used, image preview, a link to the challenge on FrontEndMentor, and a link to a live preview of my solution. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jorgemendoza2002@gmail.com. 

# Social Media Card

![Profile Card Desktop](./challenge-images/ProfileCard-Desktop.png)
A profile card component made with HTML and Sass, I used NPM to install Sass set a script up in the package.json file to watch the SCSS file as I worked. This was the easiest challenge from Front End Mentor so far, but it helped my review my knowledge on accessbility and helped me get used to using node-sass.
