# Front End Mentor Challenges
Thsi repository contains all the challenges that I have completed from the [FrontEndMentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions). The challenges varied from creating simple components, pages, to small-scale applications. 

Each challenge used various tools to complete, each section in this README contains the challenge name, description, tools used, image preview, a link to the challenge on FrontEndMentor, and a link to a live preview of my solution. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jorgemendoza2002@gmail.com.
